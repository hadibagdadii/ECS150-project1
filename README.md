This project is the development of a simple shell program (`sshell`) that replicates basic shell functionality.
It includes features such as parsing and executing commands using `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`, built-in commands (`exit`, `pwd`, `cd`, and a custom `sls`),and limited output redirection. 
The goal is to provide an interactive or batch-processing shell environment while incrementally building and refining features through various phases of implementation.
